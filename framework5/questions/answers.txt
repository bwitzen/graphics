1. What happens for cases 0011/1100 when two of the vertex values are equal to the
   ISO value and two vertex values are greater than the ISO value?

A not a clue

2. We render two-sided, without backface culling. If the isosurface froms a
   closed surface, there would be no need for this. When does an isosurface not
   from a closed surface?

A. When the ISOsurface contains a flat object - one that is thinner than the width
   of a cell.

3. Optimize the algorithm in 2.2.

A. We can parallelize the forloops for both the C and the T structures. In
   addition, some TÅ› will have shared points leading to shared vertices. For
   those, calculations are performed multipe times (=redundant).
